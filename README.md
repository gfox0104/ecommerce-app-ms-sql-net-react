<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project served as an opportunity for me to use my self-taught front-end skills and existing back-end skills to build an ecommerce. However, I quickly realized that I needed to acquire additional knowledge in various technologies to accomplish my goal. Through my exploration of technologies like C# Web API, Redux, JWT tokens, and HTTP methods, I expanded my skill set and gained the ability to develop a comprehensive full-stack e-commerce application. This experience allowed me to create an aesthetically pleasing and highly functional solution.




### Built With

* React.js
* Microsoft SQL Server
* .NET Web API
* Redux
* SCSS
